# LoLCustomLang

Changes LoL's current language to a custom defined. Simple and unobtrusive.

- Make sure to modify the `config.ini` file to match your League installation folder and your desired language:
  - `LoLPath`: Path to the League of Legends installation folder.
  - _Optionally_ enable the `CreateShortcut` to True to create a shortcut to your desktop.
    - This will make it every time you open the script so only enable it once.
  - `TargetLanguage`: Change it to one of the following:
    - ja_JP: Japanese
    - ko_KR: Korean
    - zh_CN: Chinese
    - zh_TW: Taiwanese
    - es_ES: Spanish (Spain)
    - es_MX: Spanish (Latin America)
    - en_US: English (alternatives en_GB, en_AU)
    - fr_FR: French
    - de_DE: German
    - it_IT: Italian
    - pl_PL: Polish
    - ro_RO: Romanian
    - el_GR: Greek
    - pt_BR: Portuguese
    - hu_HU: Hungarian
    - ru_RU: Russian
    - tr_TR: Turkish
- This script will kill any running client processes, so make sure to not be in game when executing it!
