# LoLCustomLang

Changes LoL's current language to a custom defined. Simple and unobtrusive.

- Make sure to modify the config.ini file to math your League installation folder and your desired language.
- Optionally enable the create shortcut to True to create a shortcut to your desktop. This will make it every time you open the script so only enable it once.
- This script will kill any running client processes, so make sure to not be in game when executing it!
